# Payments
  * autopayments should all be processed by Thursday at Noon
  * successful subscriber orders should reset their trialing date to the next thursday

## Stripe Glossary
  * Payment states:
    - uncaptured - 
    - released - 

  * Subscription States:
    - trialing
      - If a subscription is on a trial period, we’ll let you know the trial is ending via the customer.subscription.trial_will_end event. This event notification goes out 3 days before the trial period concludes (unless that’s not possible, such as when a trial is only 1 day long).
    - active
    - past_due
    - unpaid
      - To set a subscription status back to active from an unpaid or past_due state, open the most recent invoice and attempt to pay it. Note that paying any other invoice—that is not the most recent—does not change the subscription’s status.
    - canceled -> EVENT: customer.subscription.deleted
      - event's request property is null if auto-canceled
