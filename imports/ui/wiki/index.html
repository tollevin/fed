### Screen by screen spec
Fed has many different templates displayed across a handful of screens (pages). Each template is listed here under its screen, and is divided into smaller sections when necessary.

  1. **Home Page** - /
  2. **Menu Page** - /menu
    - Main
  3. **Subscribe Page** - /subscribe  
    All subscribe page templates are headed by a tracker that shows your status in the subscribe process. As of now, this tracker does not link to those parts, but is only for display.
