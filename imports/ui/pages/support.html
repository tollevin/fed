			<h2>What is Fed?</h2>

			<p>Fed is a subscription-based, prepared meal delivery service based in NYC. We make it possible for people to eat healthy consistently by delivering delicious meals made from locally sourced ingredients and prepared by a 5-star chef.</p>
			
			<h2>Subscriptions & Ordering</h2>
			<h3>How do I get Fed?</h3>

			<p><a href="/subscribe">Click here</a> and follow the instructions. You’ll be prompted to give your dietary preferences, your desired quantity of meals, your prefered delivery day, and your address. Then, enter your payment information and you’re done!</p>

			<h3>When do you deliver?</h3>

			<p>Sundays between 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM 
			Mondays between 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM</p>

			<p>All food is prepared on Sundays and with proper refrigeration will stay fresh all week long.</p>

			<p>When observing national holidays we will announce any changes in delivery days or times at least one week prior.</p>
			<h3>Where do you deliver?</h3>

			<p>We currently deliver to Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island City.</p>
			<h3>What if I have dietary restrictions or allergies?</h3>

			<p>Before subscribing, we’ll ask you to list your dietary preferences so that we can offer you a personalized experience. You can also view all of the nutrition facts for every meal prior to confirming your order.</p>

			<h3>Can I try it without committing to a subscription?</h3>

			<p>Definitely.</p>
			<h3>When is the deadline to modify my order or change my delivery day?</h3>
			<p>Wednesday at midnight.</p>
			<h3>When do I get charged for my packs?</h3>
			<p>The Thursday before the arrival of your pack.</p>
			<h3>Where do the ingredients come from?</h3>

			<p>We buy all of our ingredients from local sources, and we maintain a high standard of quality and nutritional value. This requires us to be seasonal about our meals.</p>

			<h3>How do I heat my meals?</h3>

			<p>Meals that are meant to be served warm have suggested heating instructions marked on each label. The containers we provide are microwave safe, dishwasher safe, and completely reusable. If using any kind of oven, please make sure to remove the food from it’s plastic container and place in an oven-safe dish before heating.</p>
			
			<h3>How long will my meals stay fresh?</h3>

			<p>For guaranteed freshness we recommend you consume each meal by its expiration date on the label. By using only local produce our food stays fresher a little longer because it hasn’t traveled very far. The quality of the nutrients and flavors lasts longer too.</p>

			<h3>Can I freeze my meals?</h3>

			<p>For the best quality of our prepared meals we do not recommend freezing them. However, we also want you to be able to enjoy every meal you receive and don’t want any food to go to waste, so if freezing meals is your thing, do your thing! Meats, soups, and stews generally freeze best.</p>

			<h2>Packaging</h2>
			<h3>I’ve tried other services in the past and they create so much waste! How is Fed different?</h3>

			<p>Fed takes sustainability seriously. All containers are reusable and made with recyclable materials from the state of New York. Ice packs and insulated tote bags can also be reused. Only our packaging labels are non-recylable.</p> 

			<p>If we have any leftovers we donate them to CHiPS locations throughout the city.</p>

			<h3>How do I dispose of the containers my meals come in?</h3>

			<p>Reuse or recycle them! The plastic we use is BPA free and can be safely put in the microwave and dishwasher.</p>

			<h3>Can I return my green tote bags to Fed?</h3>

			<p>Yep. Just ask one of our couriers to take any bags you'd like to return. If you're available at the time of delivery, you can even ask them to take them back right then and there.</p>

			<h2>Delivery</h2>
			<h3>How do I make sure my pack is delivered to the right place?</h3>

			<p>When entering delivery instructions during checkout, please be as descriptive and accurate as you can.</p>
			<h3>What happens if I am not home when my delivery arrives?</h3>

			<p>Our couriers will follow the delivery instructions you provide, but if something unforeseen happens, we will do our best to contact you or leave it somewhere safe. To be extra sure you receive your delivery, we recommend notifying your building or doorman.</p>

			<p>Fed is not liable for packages after they have been delivered or were not possible to deliver. Fed is not required to issue reimbursements or replacements for lost or stolen packages.</p>

			<h3>Where do the ingredients come from?</h3>
			<p>Fed sources it’s food responsibly! For us, this means local is our first priority and organic is second.  Being certified organic is an expensive and arduous process for local farmers.  While the farms we use may not be certified organic, the land is tilled and the crops are cared for with the same quality. We value transparency at Fed and will always tell you exactly what you are eating.  On the ingredients list of every meal, we mark which foods were organically sourced that week with a “*”, so you always know what is going into your body!
			<br>
			<br>Remember, if you don’t recognize an ingredient, your body won’t either.</p>


			<h3>Can I customize the ingredients of my meals?</h3>
			<p>We do not offer this option. Our 5-star chef creates unique and delicious meals out of the most natural and real ingredients. The ingredients used in each dish are intentionally chosen with your health in mind!</p>


			<h3>How do I heat my meals? </h3>
			<p>Meals that are meant to be served warm have suggested heating instructions clearly marked on each label.  The containers we provide are microwave safe, dishwasher safe, and completely reusable!  If using any kind of oven please make sure to remove the food from it’s plastic container and place in an oven-safe dish before heating!</p>  


			<h3>How long will my meals stay fresh?</h3>
			<p>For guaranteed freshness we recommend you consume each meal by its expiration date on the label.  Meals typically last 3 - 5 days and sometimes a full week!  By using only local produce our food stays fresher a little longer since it hasn’t traveled very far to get to our kitchen!  The quality of the nutrients and flavors lasts longer too!</p>


			<h3>Can I freeze my meals?</h3>
			<p>For the best quality of our prepared meals we do not recommend freezing them.  However, we also want you to be able to enjoy every meal you receive and don’t want any food to go to waste, so if freezing meals is your thing, do your thing!  Meats, soups, and stews generally freeze best.</p>


			<h3>Can I order the snacks without getting any meals?</h3>
			<p>We are working on it!  We know you love those tasty bites, and this option will be available soon.</p>
