			<h2>How Our Stomach Talks To Our Brain and the Importance of Habit</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="article-body">
			<p>“You are what you eat” may seem out of date, but recent studies show that what lives in your gut (all 100 trillion microorganisms) may be talking to your brain more than you think. Every time we eat, we release molecules into our gut, and scientists say the bacterias that break down our food send a signal to the brain to tell you what they need to function; so their cravings become your cravings. The sweet tooth phenomena, and indeed all cravings, have actually been conditioned into our bodies through habit. So what are these microorganisms saying; and how can this communication be manipulated to change dietary habits?</p>
			<p>Our cravings tell us a lot about our stomach microbial make up. Like fingerprints, the microorganisms that live in your gut are unique to each individual and consist of up to 1,000 different species, each one with its own set of nutritional needs. For the most part, they want what is best for you, but sometimes they want what is best for themselves. Some prefer fat, others prefer sugar, so when you have a craving for a candy bar, it is the sugar loving microbes sending the distress signals, not you. These manipulative buggers are even able to affect our mood and stress level.</p>
			<p>We do, however, have the power to override these little guys’ drive. Sticking to healthy and fibrous foods will bring balance to your gut, and therefore your brain! The more processed your food is, the less nutrients there are to be absorbed into the body. Leaders in the industry consider the Western diet, which primarily consists of processed foods, fats, and carbs, to be major contributors to our obesity epidemic and national health issues.</p>
			<p>All is not lost though as you can reverse these effects. If you feed the microbes that love vegetables and probiotics, they will thrive and keep your entire digestive system and metabolism running smoothly. There are various types of fiber you can get from plants that keep your good bacteria healthy, including resistant starch (found in bananas, oats, beans); soluble fiber (in onions and other root vegetables, nuts); and insoluble fiber (in whole grains, especially bran, and avocados). These are all delicious ways to keep your gut happier, directly making YOU happier. Crazy, right?! So, from now on, don’t blindly “follow your gut” ­ change it!</p>
