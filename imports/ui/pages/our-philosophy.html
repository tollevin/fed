		<h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
		<img src="">
		<h2>We Source Responsibly</h2>
		<p>Ingredients matter for more than just taste. We source from trusted local producers and suppliers who use sustainable practices for the bulk of our ingredients. Sourcing locally helps us to ensure the freshness of our ingredients while keeping a low carbon footprint. It also promotes our local economy and agriculture, helping to sustain New York's food ecosystem.</p>

		<h2>We Design Our Meals To Sustain the city</h2>
		<p>We want to help all New Yorkers sustain a balanced diet while going about their busy lives. That's why our chef designs our delicious meals 'plant-first', taking advantage of all the nutritional qualities that our local agriculture can provide. We're also continually updating our menu and ingredients to better serve the particular dietary needs of our customers.</p>

		<h2>We Make them by hand</h2>
		<p>While we aim to explore all of the possibilities that technology has in store for the kitchen, we think that it takes care to produce proper food. That's why our team prepares all of our meals and snacks artisinally, fresh for each order, with no processed ingredients.</p>

		<h2>We Package Sustainably</h2>
		<p>We strongly believe that convenience for you doesn't have to mean more waste for the planet. That's why we use locally sourced, post-consumer recycled containers from <a href="https://www.genpak.com/green-room/">GenPak</a> for our packaging. They design their products to use less plastic while remaining durable enough for reuse, and have strong commitments to buy back the plastics that we recycle. As the city ramps up its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/nyregion/compost-organic-recycling-new-york-city.html">composting</a> efforts and spreads the operation to the 5 boroughs, we'll be looking to diversify our sourcing. We also accept returns of our insulated delivery bags for cleaning and reuse.</p>

		<h2>We Deliver</h2>
		<p>After your order leaves our hands, we want to make sure it gets to you in perfect condition. That's why we've moved away from on-demand third-party services and partnered with Brooklyn-based Unstoppable Deliveries. As we grow together, we can help to ensure sustainable pay for the people who brave the city to get you Fed, while managing logistics to improve efficiency and emissions.</p>

		<h2>You enjoy</h2>
		<p>Our main goal is to make sustainable eating convenient for You. That's why our meals are easily reheatable in 3 minutes or less. Our Packs also save you up to a weeks worth of food decisions, so you can focus your energy on something that matters even more than food.</p>

		<img src="">
		<h2>We're Low Waste</h2>
		<p>We order our ingredients each week based on your orders, making our necessary waste (from food scraps and over-production) much less than most restaurants and food producers. When we do have extra food, we aim to provide it to those in need, via CHIPS and other local food outreach organizations. We also aim to conserve the resources we use in production whenever possible.</p>

		<p class="conclusion">We at Fed are striving to provide more than just a nutrition delivery service. We're striving for a sustainable, convenient, and delicious world! And we hope that you can proudly enjoy Fed just as much as we are proud to serve it.</p>
