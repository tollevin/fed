			<h2>Hey Busy NYC Dwellers,</h2>
			<p>We are GetFedNYC, your perfect support system for eating healthy in the city that never sleeps. Our mission is to make healthy eating more accessible and more delicious to every New Yorker. Bringing more vegetables to the American diet is paramount, and while we don’t eliminate meats from our menu, our focus is indeed food that comes from the ground.</p>
			<p class="f2f">Farm to Fridge is finally  here!</p>
			<p>We are always looking to enhance your experience  by making better tasting food and more convenient delivery options so you don’t have to think about what you are going to eat each week.</p>
			<p>Our intention is to take the guess work out of healthy eating all while giving you high quality foods with top notch ingredients.</p>
			<h2 class="commitments">Our 4 Pillars</h2>
			<p class="commitment">Sustainability</p>
			<p>GetFedNYC sources local first, and organic whenever possible because we are always conscious of what food we are asking our customers to consume. We do our very best to keep the menu seasonal and keeping our produce coming from local farms, which is important for consumer cost, taste, and, most importantly, sustainability. All of our packaging is 100% recyclable and reusable (including our reuseable tote bag!), which means minimum waste and a guilt-free experience for the consumer.</p>
			<p class="commitment">Creativity</p>
			<p>Our 5 Star Head Chef and his team will knock your socks off with what they can create in the kitchen! Our team of experienced chefs prepare balanced and nutritious whole food plant based menus. Making healthy taste delicious is the priority, and with dishes like Grilled Mango Chipotle Chicken, Vegetarian Lasagna with Brie Fondu, Ginger Miso Tofu, Grilled Beets and Apple with Honeyed Goat Cheese (And so much more!) we can assure you there is no shortage of flavor and variety.</p>
			<p class="commitment">Convenience</p>
			<p>GetFedNYC makes eating healthy easy. With no shopping, cooking, or clean up involved, GetFedNYC delivers exactly what you want to eat for the week and lets you eat it how and when you want, effortlessly. With the option of selecting a pre-made pack or customizing an order completely, we make healthy eating as convenient as possible for our clients.</p>
			<p class="commitment">Customer Service</p>
